--Joins
--to retrieve multiple coumns from various tables
/* types of joins
   1. Equi Join /Natural Join /Inner Join
   2. Cross Join (cartesan product)
   3. Self Join (mirror of the same table gets created. So we will have to give an alias name for the same table)
   4. Outer Join : matching records of 2 tables + the non matching records
       Left Outer Join : matching records from 2 tables + the non matching data from the left hand side table
	   Right Outer Join : matching records from 2 tables + the non matching data from the right hand side table
	   Full Outer Join : matching records from 2 tables + the non matching data from the left as well as right hand side table
