Threads: A path of Execution. A light weight process
Can be STA(single threaded apartment) or MTA(Multi threaded apartment)

Way 1:
 
//first creating an object of the delegate and manking it point to DisplayNumbers Method
            ThreadStart ts = new ThreadStart(DisplayNumbers);
            //passing the threadstart delegate object as a parameter to thread class Constructor
            Thread t4 = new Thread(ts);
            t4.Start();

Way 2: Thread t4= ne Thread(new ThreadStart(DisplayNumbers));

Way 3: 
Thread t4= new Thread(delegate(){DisplayNumbers();})

Way 4:
Thread t4= new Thread(()=>{DisplayNumbers();});

Way 5:
Thread t4= new Thread(()=>DisplayNumbers());

Way 6:

//Using Anonymous Method
Thread t4= new Thread(()=>{
for(int i=1;i<=10;i++)
{
  cw(i);
}
});
