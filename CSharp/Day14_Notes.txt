Tuples : Is a data structure that contains a sequence of elements of dufferent data types
When we need more values from a method, we can use tuples.

The different ways to return more than one value from a method :
1. Using Out Variables : But this is not allowed in async methods (parallel Execution)
2. Using Custom Datatype : But tedious and may be too much for the requirement
3. Using Dynamic Datatype : But has performance issues
