Polymorphism : 
1. Static Polymorphism/Early Binding/Compile Time Polymorphism

    - Overloading
           a)Method Overloading
           b)Operator Overloading

2. Dynamic Polymorphism/Late Binding/Runtime Polymorphism
          a)Overriding


Binding : Resolving the function calls to the actual functions

Method Overloading: -Having different methods with the same name but different arguments/parameters (Signature)
- Either the number of parameters or the type of the parameters should be different
- Seen within the class
- Just the change of the return type does not qualify the method as overloaded
- Compiler does Binding

Operator Overloading: int x,y,z; z=x+y;

class class1 {} class1 c1, c2, c3; c3=c1+c2;

Eg :  public int add (int a, int b) { return a+b; }
      public int add(int a, int b, int c) { }
      public int add(int a, float f){ }
      public float add(int a, int b) { } - not an overload


 CoVariance : Parent Object can point to any child object, but the reverse is not true 

Method Overriding :- Signature has to be the same across overridden functions/methods
- Seen across base and derived classes
- Runtime does the binding
