implicitly typed :

var : We need to assign a value to a var type while declaring itself. Once assigned cannot change the type

dynamic : An object that remains dynamic, but can take up any type and convert at the runtime. It has an overhead on Performance. Hence to limit usage of dynamic type. 

Classes and Objects : Class is a unit of all field and methods needed for the application.

Objects : are the instances of the class, which are real and workable.

Constructors : Are special functions of a class
- They have the same name as that of the class
- They have to be public or internal
- They do not have any return type
- They can be overloaded
- They are used to initialize fields
- They are called during object creation

When a class does not have a constructor of its own, the system provides a default constructor
