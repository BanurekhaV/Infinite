- Autoproperty Initializers : with C#6.0, we have a possibility of initializing the properties along side the declaration, with the options of enabling or disabling access of the properties using private {set;get;}, protected {set;get;}

- Dictionary : Is comparable to Hashtable, that both use key value pair, but differ 
  - Dictionary is generic and hence and have specific datatype for key and value.
  - Because of the above method, they are faster when compare d to HashTable. (No conversion required)
  - Dictionary throws error if the key is not found, whereas HahTable will return a null

- Exception Filters : Allows to specify a condition clause for each catch block
   - To use ecxeption filters, we need to declare the filter in the same line as that of the catch block declaration
   - If the condition evaluates to true, then catch block will be executed, else the exception continues
