Generics with objects

Generic Constraints : are restrictions for the Generic Object

Hands On:
Create a class <anyname>. Inside the class have a public method called Display as below

public void Display<T>(string msg, T Val)
{
cw("{0} :{1}", msg, Val);
}

now instantiate the class and call the Display method with different data types


Delegates : - A Reference Type that holds the reference to a Method/Function
- They are like Pointers to Functions/Methods
- Their reference can be changed dynamically
- We should declare delegates with signature
- The delegate object can refer to methods whose signature matches with the delegate

Delegates are essentially used to implements events and in callbacks


Multicast Delegates : A concept where a single object of the delegate can be pointing to multiple functions (same signature ). The same object will refer to all the multiple functions one at a time in the order of functions added.

Multicasting is not recommended when the functions return values and we need the return values for further processing, since the retun values or over written
